# Random mask SNPs
For each SNP site, randomly mask 3 or less samples in it.
The maksed number could be changed in the "rand_mask_SNP.pl" program
```
perl rand_mask_SNP.pl SNP_318merge.confirmed.all.overlap-with-hapmap.vcf SNP_318merge.confirmed.all.overlap-with-hapmap.mask.vcf SNP_318merge.confirmed.all.overlap-with-hapmap.mask.pos
